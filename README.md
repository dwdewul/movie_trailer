# Movie Trailer Website
This project is a movie trailer website containing a few of my favorite movies!

## How to use it:
In order to use this program, you need to have Python installed (v2 or v3 works).

When you install Python, be sure that you also add Python to your PATH.

Once Python is installed, simply change directories to where you saved the folder
and enter the following command `python entertainment_center.py`

That's it! Enjoy!
